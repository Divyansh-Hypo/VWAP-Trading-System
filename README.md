# 🚀 VWAP Trading System

## 📈 From Zero to Trading System in 2.5 Weeks

Built a complete VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) trading system from scratch with zero prior pandas/matplotlib knowledge. This project shows that **building > studying** and **pattern recognition > syntax memorization**.

## 🧠 My Journey
Started with NO pandas/matplotlib experience. Learned through:
- **Project-first approach** (not tutorials)
- **Pattern-based learning** (physical notebook for patterns)
- **Real market data** from day 1 (yfinance)
- **Professional debugging** (real problems = real learning)

## 📊 Features
- Real-time market data via yfinance API
- VWAP + 2σ standard deviation bands
- Session-aware daily reset logic
- Professional matplotlib visualization
- Timezone handling (UTC → IST)

## 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Divyansh-Hypo/VWAP-Trading-System

# Install dependencies

# Run the main system
